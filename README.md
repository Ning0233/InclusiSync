The product is called InclusiSync. It mainly refurbishes an existing but underused feature—the subtitle button—and reintroduces it in a way that makes it more accessible to a wider audience. Additionally, it creates an entirely new user page specifically designed for the target audience. It promotes a shorter route for users who need the feature, without disrupting others.

We also conducted original research to identify the needs of our target consumers.


Inside this repositiory, there is a collection of data collected from our target group.
